MariaDB can run on different operating systems and support a wide variety of programming languages.
MariaDB is licensed under GPL, LGPL, or BSD.
MariaDB follows a standard and popular query language.
MariaDB provides Galera cluster technology.
MariaDB provides supports for PHP which is the most popular web development language.
MariaDB includes a wide selection of storage engines, including high-performance storage engines for working with other RDBMS data sources.

- create new spring project > maven, Spring Web + Spring Data MongoDB dependencies

- create a package model and add a java class:
- @Document to set the collection name that will be used by the model
- if the collection doesnâ€™t exist, MongoDB will create it


- create a package repository
- create an BookRepository public interface which extends the MongoRepository interface


- create a main class that implements CommandLineRunner (@SpringBootApplication
